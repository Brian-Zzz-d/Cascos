## How I advance and how is my plan

I do this project in a style like wireless of any type, I want to expand the actual model to a form more proffesional like the example I go to put here, I want to put the colums in strict form and in one sigle of two columms put more boxes and then continue like this puting obviusly the information of wireless and his types and fix problems.

I advance much but this is not finished obiusly, but I do the boxes and clear the information, I want put some boxes more, fix a litles problems and create a javascript with all the information and put the formularium, and still working.

I am exicintg to show how I adavanced in this proyect, for my opinion, is good but I do some more little tings like putting more hrfes, images and registrer, to do the page more dinamic, like the medias querries but I can do it more and more good with the time, This is my proyect and I want you like it.

new: This is one of the final parts, i put hover, animation, one page named order, and touch a little thing in general part the main page, I hope you like this proyect.
